# Release process

## Overview

While our release schedule is flexible, our general strategy is to release several larger improvements inside each stable release. In order to provide faster access to fixes and enhancements between main releases we provide release candidates which are published on every merge into `main`.

### Publishing a stable release

1. Checkout latest `main`
2. Run `npm login` and supply your credentials (ensure you have access to the org scope for publishing)
3. Run `npm run release`
