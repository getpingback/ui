# Contributing to Pingback UI

## Code of Conduct

Pingback has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it.

Please read [the full text](/docs/development-code-of-conduct--docs) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Heuristics

[heuristic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)>)
/ˌhjʊ(ə)ˈrɪstɪk/

> A technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution

- Priority is the best User Experience
- Complexity should be introduced when it's inevitable
- Code should be easy to reason about
- Code should be easy to delete
- Avoid abstracting too early
- Avoid thinking too far in the future

## Preparing a Pull Request

[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with maintainers.

A good PR is small, focuses on a single feature or improvement, and clearly communicates the problem it solves. Try not to include more than one issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/ui.git
cd ui
git remote add upstream https://github.com/getpingback/ui.git
```

1. Synchronize your local `main` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

1. Make sure your Node version matches the [.nvmrc](https://github.com/getpingback/ui/blob/main/.nvmrc).

```
node -v
```

1. Install dependencies with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install
```

1. Create a new branch related to your PR:

```sh
git checkout -b my-bug-fix
```

6. Make changes, then commit and push to your forked repository:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

7. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/getpingback/ui) and [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

8. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

## Working locally

The repo is managed with npm Workspaces.

### Development

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start Storybook and see examples in the browser
npm run dev
```

Make your changes and check that they resolve the problem with an example in Storybook. We also suggest adding tests to support your change, and then run `npm run test` to make sure nothing is broken.

You also need to inform npm workspaces that a particular package has changed for proper versioning. Run `npm version check -i` to mark the appropriate type of change for those packages.

Lastly, run `npm run build` to ensure that the build runs successfully before submitting the pull request.
